# Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

# Prototype: def uppercase(str):
# You can only use no more than 2 print functions with string format
# You can only use one loop in your code
# You are not allowed to import any module
# You are not allowed to use str.upper() and str.isupper()
# Tips: ord()
# You don’t need to understand _import_


upper = input("type the word ")
for a in upper:
    if a.isupper:
        print(upper)
    else:
        print('input uppercase please')
        exit()
